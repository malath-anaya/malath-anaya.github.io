      As a software engineer, I enjoy bridging the gap between engineering and design &mdash; combining my technical knowledge
      with my keen eye for design to create a beautiful product. My goal is to always build applications that are scalable
      and efficient under the hood while providing engaging, pixel-perfect user experiences.

      or crossing off another item on my bucket list.

      I'm currently a senior student at
      <strong>Omar Bin Al-Khattab highschool</strong> finishing off a journey of 12 years with some awesome people. 
    </p>
    <p>
      In the mix of 
      <strong>Computer Science</strong> and <strong>Filmmaking</strong>, I love soaking up knowledge and often land top grades. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Immersed in the world of programming since a young age, I've always been curious about algorithmic puzzles and fascinated by transforming ideas into funtional solutions. 
      I enthusiastically used every opportunity to strengthen my understanding and skill, from doodling Python programs in my schools computer labs, to building a ML-model. Fueled by a sincere thirst for knowledge, my academic pursuits in this field have been driven by certainty in its importance. 
      I'm not just about programming; I also dig into filmmaking, storytelling, and critiquing. I'm friendly but also a bit picky when it comes to perfecting my work to produce elegant results. Team projects light me up, making tough stuff way easier. Whether coding or storytelling, I'm always curious, asking why and how.

      Learning isn't just a skill; it's a habit, even in video games.    
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>My big aim? Turn what I learn into a positive contribution for a better world.</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
      When I'm not in front of a computer screen, I'm writing, directing, and filming my ideas.
